excerpt: "About Me"
---
I'm a graduate student researcher interested in bird brains. I am currently pursuing a PhD in the lab of Claudio Mello at Oregon Health & Science University. I grew up in Austin, TX where in 2012 I earned a B.S. in Biology from the University of Texas at Austin and completed a self-made minor in Consciousness Studies. When not mining through genomes or inspecting bird brains in the lab, I enjoy cooking, reading, exploring the glorious outdoors, and watching terrible B-movies with friends.
